    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **size**: \n",
    "   - Specifies the number of results to return. In this case, it's set to 5, meaning the query will return up to 5 documents that match the search criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **query**:\n",
    "   - The top-level key indicating that the following section defines the query to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **bool query**:\n",
    "   - A boolean query allows combining multiple query clauses to achieve specific search goals.\n",
    "   - **must** clause:\n",
    "     - Contains a `multi_match` query, which searches for documents that match the `user_question` in multiple fields (`question`, `text`, `section`). \n",
    "     - The `query` parameter is dynamically filled with `user_question` (presumably a user-provided search query).\n",
    "     - `fields` specifies the fields to search in. The `^3` after `question` boosts its importance (weight) in the search results, indicating that matches in the `question` field are more significant.\n",
    "     - `type` is set to `best_fields`, which finds documents where any field matches and uses the highest score for that match.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **filter** clause:\n",
    "     - Contains a `term` query that filters documents based on exact matching of the `course` field.\n",
    "     - Specifically, it filters documents where the `course` field exactly matches `\"data-engineering-zoomcamp\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "This Elasticsearch query will return up to 5 documents where:\n",
    "- The documents must match the `user_question` in at least one of the specified fields (`question`, `text`, `section`).\n",
    "- The `question` field is given higher relevance (`^3`) in determining matches.\n",
    "- The documents must also have the `course` field set to `\"data-engineering-zoomcamp\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This query structure is typical for searching specific fields with boosted relevance and applying filters to narrow down search results based on certain criteria."

      "In physics, energy is often represented by the symbol U, E, or W. The formula for energy depends on the type of energy being described, but here are some common formulas:\n",
